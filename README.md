# Metabolic-Constraint-based-Reconstruction-Analysis-and-Visualization
This work represents one of the components of my master thesis project: "Analysis of metabolic pathways of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in alcoholic fermentation to mitigate glucose rise in grapes due to global warming effects".

Using Python packages and libraries such as: 
*COBRApy
*Escher Python
*Pandas
*Numpy
*Matplotlib

We were able to perform Constraint-based modelling techniques such as Flux Balance Analysis and Flux Variability Analysis in the target metabolic model. Aditionaly we were capable of plotting the results in different ways, and provided a visual output for our metabolic simulations.
